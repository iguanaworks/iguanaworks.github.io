Wired emitters have an LED on one end of the cable and a 3.5 mm plug for use in the socketed versions of our [USB IR Transceiver](https://www.iguanaworks.net/product/usb-ir-transceiver/ "USB IR Transceiver").

- **Homebuilt:** Our home-built Wired Emitter is 5ft long and uses the same LED as LED version of [USB IR Transceiver](https://www.iguanaworks.net/product/usb-ir-transceiver/ "USB IR Transceiver"). High-power blaster can have channel cross-talk issues — not recommended for rooms with multiple identical devices (like two DVR’s of the same make/model).
- **Smarthome / ChannelVission:** ‘Stick On’ IR emitter that is 7ft long. Significantly less power than our Homebuilt one, but can mount right next to IR receiver, so power usually isn’t a problem. Minimizes channel cross-talk and recommended for independently controlling multiple identical devices (like two DVR’s of the same make/model). Depending on availability, manufacturer will either be Smarthome or ChannelVission. Listed as Smarthome in shopping cart.
- **Smarthome / ChannelVission Dual:** Dual ‘Stick On’ is 7ft long and has two transmitting LED’s. These LED’s are _**not**_ independent — they both turn on/off together. If you want independent channels, you must buy two IR Emitters (and a stereo->mono adapter if you want to use only one socket). Depending on availability, manufacturer will either be Smarthome or ChannelVission. Listed as Smarthome Dual in shopping cart.
