# On December 31st, 2025 Iguanaworks closed down. 

It was a fun 20 years.

## Software

Our software is available on our [github repository](https://github.com/iguanaworks). The source code for igclient and igdaemon to control the Iguanaworks USB IR Transceiver is at [here](https://github.com/iguanaworks/iguanair) and the source for the LIRC driver is [here](https://github.com/iguanaworks/iguanair-lirc).

Additionally, our very out-dated wiki is no longer available, its content has a git backend and is available [here](https://github.com/iguanaworks/Wiki).

Finally, a crude conversion of our WordPress website to markdown is available [here](https://github.com/iguanaworks/website-backup) and has some basic information about our hardware (see [usb_ir_transceiver.md](https://github.com/iguanaworks/website-backup/blob/main/products/usb-ir-transceiver.md) for example.
